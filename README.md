# caliper-php
The [Caliper Analytics&reg; Specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/caliper/v1p1/caliper-spec-v1p1) 
provides a structured approach to describing, collecting and exchanging learning activity data at 
scale. Caliper also defines an application programming interface (the Sensor API&trade;) for marshalling and 
transmitting event data from instrumented applications to target endpoints for storage, analysis and use.  

*caliper-php* is a reference implementation of the Sensor API&trade; written in PHP.

## Branches
* __master__: stable, deployable branch that stores the official release history.  
* __develop__: unstable development branch.  Current work that targets a future release is merged to 
this branch.

## Tags
*caliper-php* releases are tagged and versioned MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH\[-label\] (e.g., 1.1.1). 
Pre-release tags are identified with an extensions label (e.g., "1.2.0-RC01").  The tags are stored 
in this repository.

## Contributing
We welcome the posting of issues by non IMS Global Learning Consortium members (e.g., feature 
requests, bug reports, questions, etc.) but we *do not* accept contributions in the form of pull 
requests from non-members. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more 
information.

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites for development

* PHP 5.4 required (PHP 5.6 recommended)
* Ensure you have php5 and php5-json installed:  ```sudo apt-get install php5 php5-json```
* Install Composer (for dependency management):  ```curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php```
* Install dependencies:  ```php composer.phar install```
* Run tests using the Makefile

### Installing the Library

#### Using Composer

##### Update `composer.json` method 1: Let Composer do it
In a command-line interface, use the following command to create `composer.json` (if your project doesn't
have one already) or update it (if you do have one):

```
composer require imsglobal/caliper
```

##### Update `composer.json` method 2: Do it manually
Add the following entry to the require element of the `composer.json` file for your web application:

```
  "require" : {
    "imsglobal/caliper": "*"
  },
```

##### Continuing the installation with Composer
Once `composer.json` has been updated using one of the two methods described above, the packages need to be installed.
(If you used the first method, Composer may have already done this step for you.  Doing this step again will not
cause any problems.)

In a command-line interface, change directory to the root of your web application and run the following command:

```
composer install
```

Then, add the following to your PHP program:

```
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

#### Manual installation
To install the library, clone the repository from GitHub into your desired application directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/IMSGlobal/caliper-php.git
```

Then, add the following to your PHP program:

```
require_once '/path/to/caliper-php/autoload.php';
```

### Using the Library
Now you're ready to initialize Caliper and send an event as follows:

```
use IMSGlobal\Caliper\Client;
use IMSGlobal\Caliper\Options;
use IMSGlobal\Caliper\Sensor;

$sensor = new Sensor('id');

$options = (new Options())
    ->setApiKey('org.imsglobal.caliper.php.apikey')
    ->setDebug(true)
    ->setHost('http://example.org/dataStoreURI');

$sensor->registerClient('http', new Client('clientId', $options));

// TODO: Define $event to be sent
try {
    $sensor->send($sensor, $event);
} catch (\RuntimeException $sendException) {
    echo 'Error sending event: ' . $sendException->getMessage() . PHP_EOL;
}
```

You only need to create a single instance of a Sensor object which can be then used for sending all messages.
